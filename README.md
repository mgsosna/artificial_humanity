# Artificial Humanity

## What is it?
*Artificial Humanity* is an interactive text-based video game with a branching storyline. The year is 2101 and you are the commander of a research ship in orbit around Pluto. You awaken with a headache and amnesia, and the Ship AI informs you that there has been a breach: there is an imposter on the ship. You must find the imposter, but how you do so is up to you. The branching storyline allows for dozens of playthroughs leading to multiple endings.

## How do I play it?
### I have Python installed, I know what Command Prompt is, etc.
Download this repo onto your local machine, unzip the folder, navigate to the directory via Command Prompt or Terminal, then type `python artificial_humanity.py`. All libraries the game calls should already be installed, but you can check the list below as well.

### I don't know anything about coding
For now, *Artificial Humanity* requires that you have Python installed on your computer. I love coding, so I'd say go ahead and [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ([and R](https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/) ;-)) and see what the buzz is about. Alternatively, you can wait until this is an online game, and you can just click a URL to play. Stay tuned.

### Requirements
* custom_functions (included in repo)
* numpy
* os
* pickle
* random
* time

## I played through once and died. Now what?
Try again! Run `python artificial_humanity.py` again to start over. Interesting things may happen to those who play through more than twice...

## I started playing but I have to leave... and I don't want to lose my three minutes of progress.
Not a problem. *Artificial Humanity* saves your progress at the end of every chapter. When you start playing, you have the option to load an existing file, which will take you to the last chapter you started.
